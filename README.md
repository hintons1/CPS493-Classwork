  I am currently pursuing a major in computer science, and should (hopefully) be graduating after the spring semester of 2024. So far, at New Paltz, I have taken a variety of CS courses including: Comp. Sci. I, II, and III (CPS210, CPS310, CPS315), Assembly Language and Computer Architecture (CPS330), Object Oriented Programming (CPS352), and Digital Logic Fundamentals + Lab (EGC220 + EGC221). I also took Web Page Design (CPS110) for fun last semester, so I have a little bit of prior experience with HTML and CSS. That being said, it was a 100 level course which I feel like only scratched the surface of web design; I am not as confident with my HTML and CSS as I would like, and I definitely still have a lot to learn.
	I don’t have too many projects under my belt at this point in time. I built a static web page as a part of my web design course last semester, however, I am not too happy with the results - I’m hoping to gradually improve the quality of it using the skills that you will teach us throughout the course of the semester. I also think it would be interesting to turn it into a dynamic web page, or I may use my new skills for different projects/work opportunities. I am currently also working on a much larger project for another course that I am taking this semester, and while I’m a little anxious due to the limited time frame that my group has, I am excited to see how it will come together throughout the semester.
